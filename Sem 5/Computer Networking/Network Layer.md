---

The network layer is the third layer in the [OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)](OSI%20(Open%20Systems%20Interconnection))model. The network layer is responsible for routing data packets from the source to the destination across multiple networks and devices. Its primary functions include addressing, routing, and the logical organization of data for transmission.
