> Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave 
> My heart into my mouth. I love your majesty
> According to my bond; no more nor less.

Cordelia speaks these words when she address her father, King Lear, who has demanded that his daughters tell him how much they love him before he divides his kingdom among them (1.1.90–92). In contrast to the empty flattery of Goneril and Regan, Cordelia offers her father a truthful evaluation of her love for him: she loves him “according to my bond”; that is, she understands and accepts without question her duty to love him as a father and king. Although Cordelia loves Lear better than her sisters do, she is unable to “heave” her heart into her mouth, as her integrity prevents her from making a false declaration in order to gain his wealth. Lear’s rage at what he perceives to be her lack of affection sets the tragedy in motion. Cordelia’s refusal to flatter Lear, then, establishes her virtue and the authenticity of her love, while bringing about Lear’s dreadful error of judgment.

> Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law  
> My services are bound. Wherefore should I  
> Stand in the plague of custom, and permit  
> The curiosity of nations to deprive me,  
> For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines  
> Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?  
> …  
> Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.  
> Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund  
> As to the legitimate. Fine word—“legitimate”!  
> Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,  
> And my invention thrive, Edmund the base  
> Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper.  
> Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

Edmund delivers this soliloquy just before he tricks his father, Gloucester, into believing that Gloucester’s legitimate son, Edgar, is plotting against him (1.2.1–22). “I grow; I prosper,” he says, and these words define his character throughout the play. Deprived by his bastard birth of the respect and rank that he believes to be rightfully his, Edmund sets about raising himself by his own efforts, forging personal prosperity through treachery and betrayals. The repeated use of the epithet “legitimate” in reference to Edgar reveals Edmund’s obsession with his brother’s enviable status as their father’s rightful heir. With its attack on the “plague of custom,” this quotation embodies Edmund’s resentment of the social order of the world and his accompanying craving for respect and power. He invokes “nature” because only in the unregulated, anarchic scheme of the natural world can one of such low birth achieve his goals. He wants recognition more than anything else—perhaps, it is suggested later, because of the familial love that has been denied him—and he sets about getting that recognition by any means necessary.

> O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars  
> Are in the poorest thing superfluous.  
> Allow not nature more than nature needs,  
> Man’s life’s as cheap as beast’s . . .  
> …  
> You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!  
> …  
> If it be you that stir these daughters’ hearts  
> Against their father, fool me not so much  
> To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,  
> And let not women’s weapons, water-drops,  
> Stain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,  
> …  
> No, I’ll not weep.  
> I have full cause of weeping, but this heart  
> Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,  
> Or ere I’ll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!

Lear delivers these lines after he has been driven to the end of his rope by the cruelties of Goneril and Regan (2.4.259–281). He rages against them, explaining that their attempts to take away his knights and servants strike at his heart. “O, reason not the need!” he cries, explaining that humans would be no different from the animals if they did not need more than the fundamental necessities of life to be happy. Clearly, Lear needs knights and attendants not only because of the service that they provide him but because of what their presence represents: namely, his identity, both as a king and as a human being. Goneril and Regan, in stripping Lear of the trappings of power, are reducing him to the level of an animal. They are also driving him mad, as the close of this quotation indicates, since he is unable to bear the realization of his daughters’ terrible betrayal. Despite his attempt to assert his authority, Lear finds himself powerless; all he can do is vent his rage.

> As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods;  
> They kill us for their sport.

Gloucester speaks these words as he wanders on the heath after being blinded by Cornwall and Regan (4.1.37–38). They reflect the profound despair that grips him and drives him to desire his own death. More important, they emphasize one of the play’s chief themes—namely, the question of whether there is justice in the universe. Gloucester’s philosophical musing here offers an outlook of stark despair: he suggests that there is no order—or at least no good order—in the universe, and that man is incapable of imposing his own moral ideas upon the harsh and inflexible laws of the world. Instead of divine justice, there is only the “sport” of vicious, inscrutable gods, who reward cruelty and delight in suffering. In many ways, the events of the play bear out Gloucester’s understanding of the world, as the good die along with the wicked, and no reason is offered for the unbearable suffering that permeates the play.

> Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:  
> Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so  
> That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone forever!  
> I know when one is dead, and when one lives;  
> She’s dead as earth.

Lear utters these words as he emerges from prison carrying Cordelia’s body in his arms (5.3.256–260). His howl of despair returns us again to the theme of justice, as he suggests that “heaven’s vault should crack” at his daughter’s death—but it does not, and no answers are offered to explain Cordelia’s unnecessary end. It is this final twist of the knife that makes King Lear such a powerful, unbearable play. We have seen Cordelia and Lear reunited in Act 4, and, at this point, all of the play’s villains have been killed off, leaving the audience to anticipate a happy ending. Instead, we have a corpse and a howling, ready-for-death old man. Indeed, the tension between Lear as powerful figure and Lear as animalistic madman explodes to the surface in Lear’s “Howl, howl, howl, howl,” a spoken rather than sounded vocalization of his primal instinct.

## Nihilism
> How, nothing will come of nothing. (I.i)

When Cordelia tells Lear that she can say “nothing” about her love for her father, this line is Lear’s response. His words are a warning to Cordelia—she must comply with her father’s demand for a flattering speech or risk losing her inheritance—but the line reverberates throughout the play. Lear essentially repeats it when he tells the Fool that “nothing can be made out of nothing” (I.iv), while the word “nothing” and other negatives (never, none etc.) come up over and over again. These repetitions reflect _King Lear_’s obsession with absences and loss. Lear’s declaration in the opening scene that “nothing will come of nothing” prepares the audience for a play that begins with an impulsive, senseless act and ends with no meaning, no hope and no redemption for its characters.

---
> O, thou’lt come no more,
> Never never never never never. (V.iii)

Lear addresses these words to the body of Cordelia in the play’s final scene. Cordelia’s death is the most terrible event in a play full of terrible events. She is blameless, and even the character who ordered her death, Edmund, wants to save her. Her forgiveness in her last scene had seemed to give meaning to all Lear’s suffering during the play: as a result her death confirms that all Lear’s suffering, including his grief at Cordelia’s death, is meaningless. Lear’s repetition of the word “never” is the disbelief of a bereaved parent, but it also gives voice to the shock and disbelief of the audience. Coming at the end of a play in which negatives like “never” and “nothing” have been insistently repeated, the repetition of “never” here also confirms the vision of the play as a whole: the world of _King Lear_ is a world without meaning.

> Who is that can tell me who I am?

When Lear’s daughter Goneril tells him he must dismiss some of his knights, Lear is furious. He asks this question rhetorically, not expecting an answer; Lear is just reminding Goneril that he is still king. However, the question of who Lear is lies at the center of the play. _King Lear_ asks whether it’s possible to _be_ a king if you don’t have the power of a king.

---
> O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars  
> Are in the poorest thing superfluous;  
> Allow not nature more than nature needs,  
> Man’s life is cheap as beast’s. (II.ii.)

This is Lear’s response when his daughters ask him why he needs his attendant knights. The line foreshadows that Lear will soon be living side by side with the “basest beggars.” One of the central themes of _King Lear_ is the question of whether poor and powerless people can live with meaning and dignity, or whether wealth and power are the only things that make life bearable.

---
> Blow winds and crack your cheeks! (III.ii.)

As he wanders on the heath, homeless, powerless, and buffeted by a storm, Lear is reduced to the status of a beggar. However, he continues to talk like a king. Here, he tries to give the storm orders. The absurdity of giving orders to the weather highlights how human status and power are worthless in the face of the power of nature.

---
> Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare,
> forked animal as thou art. (III.iv.)

Lear is astonished by the sight of Poor Tom, who is practically naked. He realizes that without the benefits of clothes, food, and shelter, humans are little more than animals. _King Lear_ returns repeatedly to the idea that only wealth and social status make human life bearable.

---
> Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar? And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office. (IV.vi.)

Having lost his kingdom, Lear realizes that “King” is just a title. The word is worthless without the power to back it up. By the same token, anyone can be a king if they’re powerful. Even a dog will be obeyed by people who fear its strength. _King Lear_ suggests that the distribution of wealth and power in society is random, unfair and meaningless.

---
> See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief? Hark in thine ear: change places, and, handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? (IV.vi.

Lear, who has suffered more than he deserves for his original mistake, comes to believe that justice is meaningless. Justice is one of _King Lear’s_ central themes. The play asks whether justice is a natural law or a man-made construct—or whether justice even exists at all.

---
> I am a very foolish, fond old man,  
> Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;  
> And to deal plainly,  
> I fear I am not in my perfect mind. (IV.vii.)

Lear begins the play blind to the reality of his position. He believes he will always be a king, even if he gives up his power. Over the course of the play he discovers his mistake. Finally he learns to see himself clearly, and in this speech, near the end of the play, he is able to describe himself accurately.

---
> Howl howl howl howl! (V.iii.)

This line is Lear’s first response to the death of his daughter, Cordelia. From the beginning of the play, _King Lear_ examines the power of language to express feeling. When Lear reaches his lowest point, he temporarily abandons language altogether and howls like an animal.

---
> Why should a dog, a horse, rat have life  
> And thou have none at all? (V.iii.)

Even though Lear has learned the hard truths that justice is an illusion and human beings are animals, he is not able to accept his daughter’s death. He complains that it’s unfair that other animals are alive while Cordelia is dead. Lear’s inability to reconcile himself to his loss makes his own death especially tragic.
